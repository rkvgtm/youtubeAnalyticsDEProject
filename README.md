2. ETL System: Transform raw data into the appropriate format for seamless processing.
3. Data Lake: Establish a centralized repository to accommodate data from multiple sources.
4. Scalability: Ensure the scalability of our system to handle increasing data volumes effectively.
5. Cloud Integration: Utilize cloud infrastructure, specifically AWS, to process vast amounts of data beyond the capabilities of local computing resources.
6. Reporting: Construct a comprehensive dashboard to extract insights and answers to predefined questions.Â¯

Selected AWS Services:

1. Amazon S3: Leverage this object storage service for manufacturing scalability, data availability, security, and performance.
2. AWS IAM: Implement identity and access management to securely manage access to AWS services and resources.
3. QuickSight: Utilize Amazon QuickSight, a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered business intelligence service designed for the cloud.
4. AWS Glue: Employ this serverless data integration service to facilitate the discovery, preparation, and consolidation of data for analytics, machine learning, and application development.
5. AWS Lambda: Leverage Lambda, a computing service allowing code execution without server management.
6. AWS Athena: Implement Athena, an interactive query service for S3, eliminating the need to load data as it remains in S3.
